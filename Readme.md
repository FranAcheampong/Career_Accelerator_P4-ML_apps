# ðŸš€ Friendly Web Interface for ML Projects with  Streamlit ðŸš€

## Description
*Machine learning models, regardless of their quality, remain ineffectual until they are deployed. Streamlit presents an opportunity by granting the capability to render our machine learning models beneficial to users worldwide. With a simple click on the link provided by Streamlit, individuals can conveniently access and interact with our models through the Streamlit interface. This remarkable feature empowers users to explore and manipulate the outcomes achieved by our models.*

## Project Description
The Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting dataset is a fascinating collection of data that provides a great opportunity for analysis and prediction. In this article, we will take a deep dive into the dataset, explore its various attributes, and analyze the sales patterns to build a robust sales forecasting model and answer some pertinent question on the dataset.

## Project Description


## Setup
You have two ways in order to setup and run this project.

### Manual Setup

For manual installation, you need to have [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system. Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: friendly_web_interface_for_ML_models> ...`  follow the steps below:

- Windows:
        
        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol **;** but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.
